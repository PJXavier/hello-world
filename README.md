# hello-world
As in; greetings and salutations to everyone and everything on the 3rd planet form the sun...
I have 2 loves in life, 1 is my family and the other is knowledge. Both keep surprising me, keep me humble and make me want to succeed.
However I am very aware that this is morally ambiguous and these reasons alone have led to some of the worst and most destructive decisions ever made.
